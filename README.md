# HR-Salary-Prediction
To build a salary prediction dashboard for HRs.

The project involves implementation of various supervised learning techniques like Logistic regression, Random forest classifier and Support vector classifier. 
Among them Random Forest gave the most accuracy score(0.82) after tuning the model. I have used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.

I have done this project for the internship provided by TCS iON.
